			"Cream Sherry, Alcoholic Drink, and Food Product Category are my top picks for Ice Cream. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Barefoot Bubbly Pink Moscato with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.",
