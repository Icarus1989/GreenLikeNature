			"Carrot Cake works really well with Cream Sherry, Port, and Moscato d'Asti. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try Juve & Camps Reserva de la Familia 40th Anniversary Cuvee Cava. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.",

					"Pale gold in color, this Cava has aromas of ripe white peaches, toasted baguette with hints of lemon citrus and apricots. The palate is rich and broad with flavors of green apple, jasmine green tea and toasted almonds. This brut nature cava is extremely versatile because no dosage added, so the acidity and bubbles clean your palate after each bite. Recommended dishes: garlic shrimp, miso-marinated sea bass, sesame encrusted tuna, chicken tikka masala and Jamon Iberico.",
